## AC2
There is a actor and critic .Actor is a neural netwrok which tells us what to do ,means it provide us 
the probality of actions .Critic is also a neural network which tells us how good our actions were,it
outputs state value .In practise policy and value networks partially overlap ,mostly due to the efficiency
and convergence consideration.
